      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This will be an online shop that people can go into and buy stuff from mostly clothes. For the future, I hope to add the
        options for the user to put the stuff on their site and sell it as well.        
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Online shopping is popular among those who value convenience and want to save time. 
        These individuals can shop from anywhere with an internet connection, and do not have 
        to spend time commuting or walking around stores.
        <br>
        Price-conscious shoppers: Online shopping is also popular among those who are looking 
        to save money. With online shopping, they can easily compare prices and find deals and 
        discounts that are not available in physical stores.
        <br>
        Tech-savvy individuals: Those who are comfortable with technology and enjoy using the 
        internet tend to be drawn to online shopping. They appreciate the ease of navigating 
        websites and enjoy the ability to track their purchases online.
        <br>
        Introverted or shy people: For some individuals, the thought of interacting with salespeople 
        or crowds in stores can be overwhelming. Online shopping provides a way to make purchases without 
        the need for face-to-face interaction.
        <br>
        Those with limited mobility: Online shopping can be a lifeline for individuals with limited mobility 
        or those who cannot leave their homes easily. It provides an easy way for them to shop for what they 
        need without leaving their homes.</p>  <!-- change this -->
